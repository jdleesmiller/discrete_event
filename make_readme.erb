= discrete_event

== DESCRIPTION

Some tools for discrete event simulation (DES) in Ruby.
Ruby provides most of the primitives needed to do DES in many different ways;
this package provides some extra infrastructure and examples for one simple way.
See {DiscreteEvent::Simulation} for more information, and see below for an example.

== SYNOPSIS

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'discrete_event'
<%= 
  File.readlines('test/ex_mm1_queue.rb').
    select{|l| l =~ /^\s{4}/ || l.strip.size == 0}.
    map{|l| l.sub(/^\s{2}/,'')}
%>

This and other examples are available in the +test+ directory.

== INSTALL

This is intended to be packaged as a gem, but it's not listed yet.
